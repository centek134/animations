# About Project
  This is simple project where I'm doing different animations, and display them on the screen.  
  To display animation user have to choose one from sidebar, nothing crazy about that.

## Where the idea came from?
    The main idea behind this project is that I can learn different methods to create animations and create a better user experience.  
    Who doesn't love a websites with well made animations? Also its a good project to learn Sass.

## What types of animations can we see?
    It depends, for sure there will be: 
- SVG stuff
- 3D stuff
- 2D stuff

## Where can I see this stuff?
    Once I finish making few of each type of animations, I'll post this project online and share link.
